    //c keywords
    
    /*Break - breaks out of a loop or switch statement

    case- marks a block of code in switch  statement

    char - a data type that can store a single character

    const - define a variable or parameter as a constant

    continue- continues to the next iteration of a loop
    
    default- specifies the default block of code in a switch statement
    
    do - used together with while to create a do, while loop
    
    double - a data type that is ususally 8 bytes long which can store fractional numbers
    
    else- used in conditional statements
    
    enum - declares an enumerated type
    
    float- a data type that is usually 4 bytes long
    
    for - creates a for loop
    
    goto - jumps to a line of code specid=fied by a label
    
    if- makes a conditional statement
    
    int- a data type that is usually 4 bytes long which can store whole numbers
    
    long- ensures that an integer is at least 32 bits long
    
    return- used  to return a value from a function
    
    short- reduces the size of integer to 16 bits
    
    signed- specifies that an int or char can represent both positive and negative values, for int this is the default 
    
    sizeof- an operator that returns the amount of memory occupied by a variable or data type
    
    static- specifies that a varibale in a function keeps its value after the function ends
    
    struct- defines a structure
    
    switch- selects one of many code blocks to be executed
    
    typedef- defines a custom data type
    
    unsigned - specifies that an int or char should only represent positive values which allows for storing numbers up to twice as large
    
    void - indicates a functin that does not returns a value or specifies a pointer to a data with an unspecified type
    
    while - cretaes a while loop */
