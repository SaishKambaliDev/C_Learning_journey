abs() return the absolute value of a number

atof() function reads a representation of a number from a string and returns its value.

while reading it first skips over any whitespaces and then reads 
reads all of the characters until it runs into one which is not prat of the number. If the character 
it reads do not form a valid number representation it returns 0;

if the number is not at the beginnning of the string we can use a 
pointer to a different position in the string atof(&str[n])

atof(cont char *str);

atoi() returns an int value  from a string representation of a whole number

atol() returs a long int value from a string representation of a whole number

atoll() returns a long long int value from a string representation of a whole number

calloc() allocate dynnamic memory and fill it with zeroes

div() return the quotient and remainder of an integrr division
returns a div_t structure with  int members
the  returned structure has two members:
quot- represents the quotient
rem - remiander of the division

exit() ends the  program

free() deallocate dynamic memory

malloc() allocate dynamic memory

qsort() functionn sorts the elements in an array from least to the greatest
qsort(void *arr, size_t amount, size_t size, compare)

rand() geneartes a random number

realloc() reallocate dynamic memory

srand() initialize the random number generator
