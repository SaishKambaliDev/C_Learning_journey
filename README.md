# C Learning Journey 

Welcome to my C Programming Learning Journey. This repository contains all the C programs I have written while learning the language, starting from basic syntax and control flow to advanced concepts such as pointers, memory management, file handling, and small practical projects.

The purpose of this repository is to build strong programming fundamentals, understand how C works internally, and prepare for technical interviews through consistent hands-on practice. All programs are organized topic-wise into folders so that each concept is easy to understand and revisit.

This repository covers core C concepts including basics of C programming, control flow statements (if, switch, loops, ternary operator), functions and function pointers, arrays and strings, pointers and double pointers, structures, enums and typedef, dynamic memory management, file handling, standard C libraries, and mini projects that apply these concepts in real problems.

Folder Structure:

01_Basics  
02_Control_Flow  
03_Functions  
04_Arrays  
05_Pointers  
06_Strings  
07_Structures_Enum_Typedef  
08_Memory_Management  
09_File_Handling  
10_Standard_Libraries  
11_Mini_Projects  

To run any program, compile it using:

gcc filename.c  

and then execute:

./a.out  (On Windows, run a.exe)

Through this repository, my goal is to strengthen my C fundamentals, improve problem-solving skills, gain confidence in pointers and memory concepts, and become internship and interview ready. I plan to continue adding more programs, mini projects, and improving code documentation as I progress.
